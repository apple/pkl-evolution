= Scheme-agnostic Projects

* Proposal: link:./SPICE-0005-scheme-agnostic-projects.adoc[SPICE-0005]
* Author: link:https://github.com/bioball[Dan Chao]
* Status: Accepted
* Implemented in: Pkl 0.26
* Category: Language

== Introduction

This SPICE proposes a way to allow projects to be usable within modules that are not files.

== Motivation

A _project_ is a mechanism that allows users to manage dependencies, common evaluator settings, and create packages.

Currently, a project is also restricted to the local filesystem.
For example, it is not possible to tell Pkl that the project directory is `alternativescheme:/path/to/my/project`.

This limitation is a pain-point in some circumstances.

* When Pkl is embedded as a library in Java, it is common to embed Pkl modules as Java resources, and load them via link:https://pkl-lang.org/main/current/language-reference/index.html#module-path-uri[modulepath] URIs.
* When Pkl is embedded in Go, it is common to embed Pkl files using an embedded filesystem `go:embed` directive, and passed to Pkl using the `pkl.WithFs` option.

Because these URIs are not files, it is not possible to use any project features in either of these two scenarios.

== Proposed Solution

There are to main changes to be made:

1. Instead of a "project directory", a project is identified by a base URI.
2. Relative paths starting with `@` are _always_ treated as link:https://pkl-lang.org/main/current/language-reference/index.html#dependency-notation-uris[dependency notation], in all modules.

== Detailed design

=== Language-level dependency notation

Currently, paths that are prefixed with `@` _only_ have special meaning if declared within file-based, or package-based modules.
In these modules, this prefix is the marker of link:https://pkl-lang.org/main/current/language-reference/index.html#dependency-notation-uris[dependency notation].
In all other modules, this symbol has no special meaning.
For example, in module `modulepath:/foo.pkl`, the import `@bar/bar.pkl` is resolved as `modulepath:/@bar/bar.pkl`.

This behavior conflicts with the ability to import dependencies from non-file-based modules.

To support this feature, the `@` prefix is changed to a language level resolution rule.

To resolve dependency notation, Pkl follows these rules:

1. If the module's scheme is `package` or `projectpackage`, resolve as the package's dependency, following today's rules (skip steps 2 and onwards).
2. If there is no project base URI, throw an error.
3. If the module's URI is not within the project base URI, throw an error. This can never be true if the module's URI does not have hierarchical paths.
4. Resolve to a project dependency associated with the dependency notation simple name.

=== Resolving `PklProject.deps.json`

When resolving a project's dependencies, Pkl will look for a file called `PklProject.deps.json` that is a sibling of the `PklProject` file.
Currently, this is done as a simple file read.

To accomodate arbitrary URI schemes, Pkl will treat this as a module read.
Evaluating with project base URI `modulepath:/foo/bar` means that Pkl will read `modulepath:/foo/bar/PklProject.deps.json` through the `ModuleKey` API in Java, and the link:https://pkl-lang.org/main/current/bindings-specification/message-passing-api.html#read-module-request[Read Module Request] message when using the message passing API.

To create these files, users are still expected to use standard tooling (CLI link:https://pkl-lang.org/main/current/pkl-cli/index.html#command-project-resolve[pkl project resolve], or the link:https://pkl-lang.org/main/current/pkl-gradle/index.html#project-resolving[Gradle project resolver task]).

=== Java bindings changes

Class `org.pkl.core.Project` receives an additional static method `org.pkl.core.project.Project#load(org.pkl.core.ModuleSource)`, which spawns an evaluator, and loads the given `ModuleSource` as a `org.pkl.core.Project`.

[source,java]
----
class Project {
  public static Project load(ModuleSource moduleSource);
}
----

Users of `modulepath`-based projects can configure their evaluator like so:

[source,java]
----
// Set the project directory as a classpath directory by loading it as a ModuleSource.classPath
var project = Project.load(ModuleSource.classPath("/com/example/pkl/PklProject"));

var evaluator = EvaluatorBuilder.preconfigured().setProjectDependencies(project.getDependencies()).build();

// or for users of ConfigEvaluator:
var configEvaluator = ConfigEvaluatorBuilder.preconfigured().setProjectDependencies(project.getDependencies()).build();
----

=== Message Passing API

The message passing API does not receive any changes.

[[client-library-changes]]
=== pkl-go, pkl-swift Changes

In projects pkl-go and pkl-swift, the `projectDir` property is changed to `projectBaseUri`.

In addition, their respective `Project` interfaces receive a mechanism to load from a `ModuleSource`.

=== `pkl.Project` standard library changes

Some fields within `Project.pkl` are meant for interaction with the Pkl CLI.
For example, `EvaluatorSettings.modulePath` is meant to be a list of files on the local filesystem that determines the program's `modulepath:`.

The values for these fields are _paths_ for the local filesystem.
In the regular scenario, relative paths are interpreted as relative to the enclosing PklProject file.
This does not translate if the enclosing PklProject is not a `file:`-based module in the first place.

The properties are invalid if the project is not a `file:`-local URI:

* link:https://pkl-lang.org/package-docs/pkl/current/Project/EvaluatorSettings.html#modulePath[EvaluatorSettings.modulePath]
* link:https://pkl-lang.org/package-docs/pkl/current/Project/EvaluatorSettings.html#moduleCacheDir[EvaluatorSettings.moduleCacheDir]
* link:https://pkl-lang.org/package-docs/pkl/current/Project/EvaluatorSettings.html#moduleCacheDir[EvaluatorSettings.rootDir]

These fields receive a new type constraint.

[source,pkl]
----
local isFileBasedProject = projectFileUri.startsWith("file:")

evaluatorSettings: EvaluatorSettings(
  (modulePath != null).implies(isFileBasedProject),
  (rootDir != null).implies(isFileBasedProject),
  (moduleCacheDir != null).implies(isFileBasedProject)
)
----

=== Local Dependencies

A project can optionally have link:https://pkl-lang.org/main/current/language-reference/index.html#local-dependencies[local dependencies].
During import, they are resolved from a URI that is local to the project base URI.

Local dependencies, from the perspective of the declared module, are just packages, and packages can be globbed.
However, the resolved URI might not be globbable.
This is the case for `modulepath:` modules.
In these situations, an error is thrown.

[source,pkl]
----
import* "@localProject/*.pkl"
----

Throws error:

[source,text]
----
-- Pkl Error --
Cannot expand glob pattern "@localProject/*.pkl" because scheme `modulepath:` is not globbable.
----

== Compatibility

=== Language changes

Relative path imports starting with `@` will break.

Practically speaking, this isn't expected to have much of an impact; `@`-prefixed paths are well understood to be dependencies.

=== Library changes

The pkl-swift and pkl-go have breaking changes as detailed in <<client-library-changes>>.

== Future directions

N/A

== Alternatives considered

=== Reading `PklProject.deps.json`

In order to read the `PklProject.deps.json` file, two other approaches were considered:

The first was to use the resource reader API.
This is consistent with the fact that this is not a Pkl module, and a regular resource might be the more natural classification.
However:

1. Module readers and resource readers both represent in-language operations (`import` and `read` respectively), and reading `PklProject.deps.json` is not an in-language operation. It is not necessarily more honest to call this a "resource read".
2. It requires that users configure an evaluator with an additional resource reader, which might not have any bearing for `read()` calls.
3. The module reader is already a necessary part of the evaluator's configuration.

Another option was to register an additional extension point. For example, to introduce a new message passing request/response pair.
However, this adds to the API surface area, and the operation is essentially what a module or resource reader can already do.
