= Const checks in typealiases

* Proposal: link:./SPICE-0007-const-checks-in-typealiases.adoc[SPICE-0007]
* Author: https://github.com/bioball[Dan Chao]
* Status: Accepted
* Implemented in: Pkl 0.26
* Category: Language

== Introduction

This SPICE proposes a new requirement that references from a typealias body must be `const`.

[[motivation]]
== Motivation

Typealias bodies may contain constraints, where these constraints may reference values _outside_ of the typealias body's.

Currently, there is no restriction on what can be referenced.

Here is a module that defines a typealias which a typecheck will always pass:

.module1.pkl
[source,pkl]
----
typealias MyValue = Any(isValid)

isValid = true
----

The meaning of `MyValue` can be changed by an amending module.
In this module, `MyValue` is changed to a typecheck that will always fail.

.module2.pkl
[source,pkl]
----
amends "module1.pkl"

isValid = false
----

Following this further, this should mean that `module1.MyValue` defined a _different type_ than `module2.MyValue`.

.module3.pkl
[source,pkl]
----
import "module1.pkl"
import "module2.pkl"

value1: module1.MyValue // always passes
value2: module2.MyValue // never passes
----

Note: in version 0.25, this actually does not work because of a scoping problem.
This bug was partially fixed by https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/144[#144].

This is inconsistent with the principle set by classes.
We do not allow the meaning of a class to change by amending its enclosing module.
This is done by enforcing that any references outside its class body must be `const`.
If `module1.MyValue` was a class instead of a typealias, it should be impossible for `module2.MyValue` to behave differently.

== Proposed Solution/Detailed Design

To follow the same principle, a new rule will be introduced, that any references from a typealias body must also be `const`.
This is the same rule that already exists for references from inside class bodies.

.module1.pkl
[source,pkl]
----
typealias MyValue = Any(isValid)

isValid = true
----

This should produce the following error:

[source]
----
-- Pkl Error --
Cannot reference `isValid` from here because it is not `const`.
1 | typealias MyValue = Any(isValid)
                            ^^^^^^^
----

== Compatibility

This is a breaking change.
If typealiases reference module-level properties, those properties must be marked `const` to be compatible.
This means that there will be Pkl code that is incompatible, and need to be updated to keep working.

[source,diff]
----
 typealias MyValue = Any(isValid)

-isValid = true
+const isValid = true
----

== Future directions

N/A

== Alternatives considered

The alternative here is to allow references within typealiases to be late-bound.
This alternative is explored in https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/510[#510].

In this proposal, Pkl follows the behavior outlined in the <<motivation>> section of this SPICE.
As already detailed, this means that a _type_ can be changed by amending its enclosing module.
Furthermore, two new language changes are required:

1. The identity of a runtime typealias value should also be changed when referenced from an amending module, because they represent different type checks.
2. Classes can only use a typealias if the typealias body does not reference a const value.

[source,pkl]
----
import "module1.pkl"
import "module2.pkl"

value1: module1.MyValue // always passes
value2: module2.MyValue // never passes

areEqual = module1.MyValue == module2.MyValue // false

class MyClass {
  prop1: module1.MyValue // Error, cannot use type `module1.MyValue` because it references a non-const value
  prop2: TypeAlias = module1.MyValue // Error, cannot reference typealias `module1.MyValue` because it references a non-const value
}
----

The benefits of this approach are that typealiases are more powerful.
It makes it possible to define multiple typealiases that are related to each other by simply amending the enclosing module.
It also allows module authors to replace module-level property types with typealiases as-is.

The core problem with this approach is that it breaks the principle that a type cannot be changed by way of object amending.
The implications behind this are that the meaning of a type is more complicated.
To understand what a type means, it is not enough to look at the declaration site of the typealias; it is also important to know where the typealias is referenced from.

Another problem is that this behavior adds more time and space complexity to the language runtime.
Instead of typealiases being statically defined, they are defined per module amend.

Additionally, it's unclear what to do if the module is amended as an object.

[source,pkl]
----
import "module1.pkl"

// myObj now has its own synthetic `MyValue` typealias. But how do you reference it?
myObj = (module1) { isValid = false }
----

Practically speaking, only a small amount of Pkl code was observed to be breaking this rule.
The violations of this rule that we found were modules that reference `local` members, where these typealiases don't rely on late binding anyway, and can easily be updated to `const local`.
The benefit of being "more powerful" isn't observed to be useful in real-world Pkl code.
