= HTTP Rewrites

* Proposal: link:./SPICE-0016-http-rewrites.adoc[SPICE-0016]
* Status: Accepted
* Implemented in: 0.29
* Category: Language, Tooling

== Introduction

This SPICE proposes a new evaluator option to allow rewriting HTTP URLs, with the intention of supporting package mirroring.

This proposal supersedes https://github.com/apple/pkl-evolution/pull/4[SPICE-0002].

NOTE: The design of the mirror server is out-of-scope for this proposal.

== Motivation

For systems that require run-time air-gapping, packages imported from `pkg.pkl-lang.org` or other sites on the internet are not available.
This can be remedied by pre-populating a cache directory with all required dependencies (see link:SPICE-0001-import-graph-analyzer-api.adoc[SPICE-0001]).
When dependencies can not be determined ahead of time, pre-populating the cache is not an option.
Mirroring packages from internet repositories in a local store is insufficient, because the mirrored packages may have hard-coded dependencies.
Importing mirrored packages, using URIs pointing to the mirror, will eventually evaluate `import`s of those hard-coded dependencies, referring to external sites.

== Proposed Solution

A new HTTP setting will be added, called `rewrites`.
A rewrite is a mapping of HTTP prefixes.
For example, a rewrite might look like this:

.~/.pkl/settings.pkl
[source,pkl]
----
amends "pkl:settings"

http {
  rewrites {
    ["https://foo.org/"] = "https://bar.org/"
  }
}
----

This will replace all outbound calls to `https://foo.org/` with an outbound call to `https://bar.org/`.

In practice, an HTTP rewrite for Apple's published packages might look like:

.~/.pkl/settings.pkl
[source,pkl]
----
amends "pkl:settings"

http {
  rewrites {
    ["https://pkg.pkl-lang.org/"] = "https://my.internal.mirror/pkg-pkl-lang/"
    ["https://github.com/"] = "https://my.internal.mirror/github-releases/"
  }
}
----

With this setup, Pkl will make HTTP calls to `https://my.internal.mirror` when downloading Pkl packages.
In practice, this would be a server that fetches those assets from the underlying locations and responds with the same bytes.

== Detailed design

Underneath the hood, Pkl makes all outbound requests using `org.pkl.core.http.RequestRewritingClient`.
Currently, this client modifies outbound requests to add Pkl's user-agent, and optionally a port.
This client will be modified to also rewrite the entire URI if set.

The HTTP client will _not_ execute a rewrite in the case of 3XX response codes.

In the case of failed requests, the thrown message includes details about the rewrite.

Sample message:

[source]
----
Pkl Error
An I/O error occurred when making request GET /foo:
Connection reset

Request was rewritten:
  Original:  https://foo.com/foo
  Rewritten: https://bar.com/foo
----

A rewrite rule has a case-insensitive match on schemes and hostnames.

Thus, a rewrite rule of `\https://foo.com/` will match `HTTPS://FOO.COM/`, `\https://FOO.COM/`, and also `\https://foo.COM/`.

NOTE: Rewrite rules must start with `http://` or `https://` (see <<validation>>).

An the case of multiple matches, the longest rewrite rule has precedence over a shorter rewrite rule.
This means that the most specific rule wins.

In the following example, `\https://example.com/foo/` is the longest and is thus used to rewrite a request to `\https://example.com/foo/qux.pkl`.

[source,pkl]
----
rewrites {
  ["https://example.com/foo/"] = "<rewrite1>"
  ["https://example.com/"] = "<rewrite2>"
}
----

[[configuration-api]]
=== Configuration API

HTTP rewrites can be configured via the standard library, in Java as an API, as a CLI flag, as a server message API, and as a Gradle API.

Users of the `pkl` CLI are encouraged to configure HTTP rewrites in `~/.pkl/settings.pkl` for the purpose of package mirroring.
This will have the effect of enabling mirroring for all `pkl` CLI calls for that shell user.

==== Standard Library

A new property will be added to class `pkl.EvaluatorSettings.Http`.

.EvaluatorSettings.pkl
[source,pkl]
----
const local hostnameRegex = Regex(#"https?://([^/?#]*)"#)

const local hasNonEmptyLowercaseHostname = (it: String) ->
  let (hostname = hostnameRegex.findMatchesIn(it).getOrNull(0)?.groups?.getOrNull(1)?.value)
    hostname != null
      && hostname.length > 0
      && hostname.toLowerCase() == hostname

/// A key or value in [Http.rewrites].
///
/// Rewrite targets must satisfy the following:
///
/// * It starts with either `http://`, or `https://`.
/// * It ends with `/`.
/// * It has a non-empty and lowercased hostname.
typealias HttpRewrite = String(
  startsWith(Regex("https?://")),
  endsWith("/"),
  hasNonEmptyLowercaseHostname
)

class Http {
  @Since { version = "0.29.0" }
  rewrites: Mapping<HttpRewrite, HttpRewrite>?
}
----

This property can then be set in a PklProject, or the settings file, because they both have properties of type `Http`:

.PklProject
[source,pkl]
----
amends "pkl:PklProject"

evaluatorSettings {
  http {
    rewrites {
      // etc
    }
  }
}
----

~/.pkl/settings.pkl
[source,pkl]
----
amends "pkl:settings"

http {
  rewrites {
    // etc
  }
}
----

==== Java API

Users of the Java API can configure HTTP settings when building `org.pkl.core.http.HttpClient` via the builder.

The following methods will be added:

[source,java]
----
interface HttpClient {
  interface Builder {
    Builder setRewrites(Map<String, String> rewrites);

    Builder addRewrite(String sourcePrefix, String targetPrefix);
  }
}
----

==== Server API

Users of other language bindings (Kotlin, Go, etc), can configure rewrites via property `http` in `CreateEvaluatorRequest`:

[source,pkl]
----
class CreateEvaluatorRequest {
  http: Http
}

class Http {
  rewrites: Mapping<String, String>?
}
----

==== Gradle API

Class `BasePklSpec` will have a new property:

[source,java]
----
class BasePklSpec {
  MapProperty<String, String> getHttpRewrites();
}
----

It can then be set in any Pkl task:

.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
pkl {
  evaluators {
    register("evalPkl") {
      httpRewrites = mapOf("https://foo.com" to "https://bar.com")
    }
  }
}
----

==== CLI flag

A new flag is introduced: `--http-rewrite`.

It accepts `key=value` pairs, and can be repeated.

Example:
[source,shell]
----
pkl eval \
  --http-rewrite https://foo.com/=https://bar.com/ \
  myModule.pkl
----

This flag will be available to commands that use common CLI options (for example, `eval`, `test`, `project`).

=== Security checks

All outbound requests will be checked against the `--allowed-modules` and `--allowed-resources` CLI flags, and their respective settings in other contexts.
This is also the case with URL rewriting.

[[validation]]
=== Validation

Rewrite rules have the following requirements:

1. They must start with either `http://` or `https://`, and end in `/`.
2. They must end in `/`. this prevents a scenario where users declare a rule like `\https://foo.com/`, and unintentionally match a hostname like `\https://foo.community/`.

=== Error modes

==== Invalid rewrite rule

Validation is performed at the site where the rewrite rule is configured.

* Pkl rewrite rules (those set in `~/.pkl/settings.pkl` or `PklProject`) will be surfaced as a Pkl validation error.
* CLI flags will be surfaced as invalid flag arguments.
* Gradle rewrite rules will throw a `GradleException`.
* Otherwise, an error is thrown when building the evaluator.

== Compatibility

This change is strictly backwards compatible with current versions of Pkl; any existing program will continue to work as-is.

Users of the <<configuration-api,new API>> will need to use this version of Pkl or newer.

== Future directions

N/A

== Alternatives considered

=== Regex-based replacements

Another option is to allow users to configure rewrites using regexes.

This allows for more complex replacement patterns, where placeholders are used to construct replacement URLs.

This is particularly useful for setting up package mirroring for pkg.pkl-lang.org, which is really just a redirect site for GitHub releases.

For example, assuming that `https://my.github.mirror` is a straight mirror for GitHub.com, the following settings are sufficient to set up package mirroring for packages from pkg.pkl-lang.org:

[source,pkl]
----
http {
  rewrites {
    [#"https://pkg\.pkl-lang\.org/(.+)/(.+)#"] = "https://my.github.mirror/apple/$1/releases/download/$2/$2"
    [#"https://pkg\.pkl-lang\.org/github\.com/(.+)/(.+)/(.+)#"] = "https://my.github.mirror/$1/$2/releases/download/$3/$3"
    [#"https://github\.com/(.+)"#] = "https://my.github.mirror/$1"
  }
}
----

There are some downsides to regex-based replacements.

For one, they are more error-prone.
Regex tokens need to be escaped, and it can be a common mistake to assume that `.` is a verbatim dot in `--http-rewrite https://foo.com=https://bar.com`.

Secondly, different regular expression engines behave differently;
A Java regex is not the same as a PCRE regex.
Using regular expressions to describe string replacements can be challenging to debug if configured from another language whose regular expressions follow different semantics (e.g. PCRE, JavaScript).

Thirdly, regular expressions are brittle, can be hard to understand, and can lead to hard-to-maintain configurations (How does this regex turn into my replacement?).

=== Module/Resource URI rewrites (SPICE-0002)

https://github.com/apple/pkl-evolution/pull/4[SPICE-0002] explores module/resource URI rewrites.

That proposal has differs from this proposal in the following ways:

1. The rewrite happens by replacing the resolved module URI or resource URI (e.g. `read("http://foo.com")` is replaced with `read("https://bar.com")`)).
2. The rewrite allows any scheme to be swapped with any other scheme.

However, this type of rewrite is not sufficient for package mirroring.
The in-language URIs have schemes `package:` or `projectpackage:`, and the outbound HTTP calls here are an implementation of the module reader or resource reader.
Specifically, package URLs invoke two HTTP requests; one to fetch JSON metadata, and one to fetch package zip contents.

If `package://pkg.pkl-lang.org/foo@1.0.0#/myfile.txt` is replaced with `package://my.internal.mirror/foo@1.0.0#/myfile.txt`, this alone cannot actually mirror the package, because Pkl needs to understand that the package zip URL _also_ needs to be rewritten.
