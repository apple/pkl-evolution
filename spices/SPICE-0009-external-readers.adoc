= External Readers

* Proposal: link:./SPICE-0009-external-readers.adoc[SPICE-0009]
* Author: https://github.com/HT154[Jen Basch]
* Status: Accepted
* Implemented in: Pkl 0.27
* Category: Language

== Introduction

This SPICE proposes a way for custom module and resource readers to be used when evaluating modules with `pkl eval`.

== Motivation

When used via language binding libraries, custom module and resource readers schemes may be implemented by client code.
Custom readers help bridge Pkl into systems where it doesn't fit natively, enabling a wide variety of use cases:

* Mediating access to resources that require authentication (eg. a secret store)
* Querying data accessible via non-HTTP protocols (eg. LDAP)
* Providing filesystem abstractions for remote or in-memory modules
* And more!

One of the primary drawbacks to custom readers is that using one instantly turns a Pkl module into a _incompatible language_: the module may only be evaluated by the client tool or application providing the reader and can no longer be evaluated directly using `pkl eval`.
This hinders development and debugging of such modules, as typical workflows involving `trace(<expr>)` or `pkl eval -x '<expr>'` behave differently or are no longer possible.

== Proposed Solution

The existing message passing API and client libraries will be expanded to support external readers.
Instead of client libraries invoking `pkl server`, `pkl eval` invocations, when configured with an external reader, will run the reader executable as a subprocess.
External readers can provide any number of resource and/or module schemes and will be configured as an executable and list of arguments via:

* CLI flag
* PklProject property
* Java API
* Message passing API

[source,pkl]
----
/// May be specified as an absolute path to an executable
/// May also be specified as just an executable name, in which case it will be resolved according to the PATH environment variable
executable: String

/// Command line arguments that will be passed to the reader process
arguments: Listing<String>
----

=== Example

Consider this module:

[source,pkl]
----
username = "john_appleseed"

email = read("ldap://ds.example.com:389/dc=example,dc=com?mail?sub?(uid=\(username))").text
----

Pkl doesn't implement the `ldap:` resource URI scheme natively, but an external reader can provide it.
Assuming a hypothetical `pkl-ldap` binary implementing the external reader protocol and the `ldap:` scheme is in the `$PATH`, this module can be evaluated as:

[source,text]
----
$ pkl eval <module> --external-resource-reader ldap=pkl-ldap
username = "john_appleseed"
email = "appleseed@example.com"
----

In this example, the external reader may provide both `ldap:` and `ldaps:` schemes.
External readers are registered by their scheme, so to support both schemes both would need to be specified on the command line:
[source,text]
----
$ pkl eval <module> --external-resource-reader ldap=pkl-ldap --external-resource-reader ldaps=pkl-ldap
----

Registering an external reader for a scheme automatically adds that scheme to the default allowed modules/resources.
As with Pkl's built-in module and resource schemes, setting explicit allowed module or resources overrides this behavior and appropriate patterns must be specified to allow use of external readers.

== Detailed design

To avoid terminology confusion with the existing language binding message passing model, the `pkl` process will remain known as the "server" and the reader process will be known as the "client", despite all requests in this proposal being initiated by the `pkl` process.

=== Overall Flow

. User requests an evaluator (via Java API, Message Passing API, or CLI) with an external reader.
. The entrypoint (client Java code, `CliEvaluator`, or `Server`) instantiates an `ExternalProcess` based on the configured external readers.
. The entrypoint instantiates resource readers (`ResourceReaders.External`) and module key factories (`ModuleKeyFactories.External`) referencing the `ExternalProcess` and uses them to build an evaluator.
`ResourceReaders.External` and `ModuleKeyFactories.External` function almost identically to the existing `ClientResourceReader` and `ClientModuleKeyFactory` and pkl-server will be updated to reuse these implementations where possible.
. Evaluation begins.
. A resource or module read is encountered.
. Upon first read only:
.. The `ExternalProcess` is started, which starts the configured child process.
.. The child process is sent a `Initialize(Module|Resource)ReaderRequest` message.
.. A `Initialize(Module|Resource)ReaderResponse` message is received (within some timeout).
. The appropriate `Read*Request` message is sent to the child process, the corresponding `Read*Response` message is awaited.
. Evaluation continues.
. Evaluation completes.
. The evaluator is closed.
.. The `ExternalReader` is closed, the child process is sent the `CloseExternalProcess` message.
.. If the child process has not terminated after the set timeout (3 seconds), it is forcefully stopped via SIGKILL.

=== Java API

New APIs:

* `ResourceReaders.External` - a `ResourceReader` implementation identical to `ClientResourceReader`.
* `ModuleKeyFactories.External` - a `ModuleKeyFactory` implementation similar to `ClientModuleKeyFactory`.
* `ModuleKeys.External` - a `ModuleKey` implementation identical to `ClientModuleKey`.
* `ExternalProcess` - manages the lifecycle of child processes.
    ** Explicit `close` methods to manage child process lifecycle.
    ** The `ExternalProcess` spawns the subprocess on first access, which sets up the `MessageTransport`, sends the appropriate `Initialize*ReaderRequest` message, and awaits the corresponding `Initialize*ReaderResponse` response.
* `ExternalReaderClient` - implements the client-side workflow for external readers.

This proposal requires that the message passing API functionality move out of pkl-server and into pkl-core.
The code added to pkl-core will include the new APIs and the core messaging code currently part of pkl-server (`pkl-server/src.main/kotlin/org.pkl.server/Message*.kt`).

=== Message Passing API

`CreateEvaluatorRequest` will be expanded with additional properties:
[source,pkl]
----
externalModuleReaders: Mapping<String, ExternalReader>?

externalResourceReaders: Mapping<String, ExternalReader>?

class ExternalReader {
  /// May be specified as an absolute path to an executable
  /// May also be specified as just an executable name, in which case it will be resolved according to the PATH environment variable
  executable: String

  /// Command line arguments that will be passed to the reader process
  arguments: Listing<String>
}
----

Five new message types will be added:

[source,pkl]
----
/// Code: 0x100
/// Type: Server Request
class InitializeModuleReaderRequest {
  /// A number identifying this request.
  requestId: Int

  /// The scheme of the resource to initialize.
  scheme: String
}

/// Code: 0x101
/// Type: Client Response
class InitializeModuleReaderResponse {
  /// A number identifying this request.
  requestId: Int

  /// Client-side module reader spec.
  ///
  /// Null when the external process does not implement the requested scheme.
  /// [ClientModuleReader] is defined at https://pkl-lang.org/main/current/bindings-specification/message-passing-api.html#create-evaluator-request
  spec: ClientModuleReader?
}

/// Code: 0x102
/// Type: Server Request
class InitializeResourceReaderRequest {
  /// A number identifying this request.
  requestId: Int

  /// The scheme of the resource to initialize.
  scheme: String
}

/// Code: 0x103
/// Type: Client Response
class InitializeResourceReaderResponse {
  /// A number identifying this request.
  requestId: Int

  /// Client-side resource reader spec.
  ///
  /// Null when the external process does not implement the requested scheme.
  /// [ClientResourceReader] is defined at https://pkl-lang.org/main/current/bindings-specification/message-passing-api.html#create-evaluator-request
  spec: ClientResourceReader?
}

/// Code: 0x104
/// Type: Server One Way
class CloseExternalProcess {}
----

The `CloseExternalProcess` message exists primarily because different operating systems provide different abilities to gracefully stop child processes.
Using an in-band message for this purpose reduces the need for external reader developers to address OS-specific implementation details.

=== CLI

New `--external-resource-reader` and `--external-module-reader` CLI argument will be added to configure external readers.
The arguments can be provided multiple times to configure multiple external readers.
The arguments are passed as `=`-delimited key-value pairs where the key is the reader's URI scheme.
The argument values may be passed as space-separated strings where the first element becomes `executable` and any remainder becomes `arguments`.

TBD: It might be best if the argument value is link:https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.split[shlex'd] instead of split to support passing arguments to the reader process that contain spaces.

=== Standard Library

The `EvaluatorSettings` module will be expanded to enable configuring external readers in `PklProject` files:

[source,pkl]
----
externalModuleReaders: Mapping<String, ExternalReader>?

externalResourceReaders: Mapping<String, ExternalReader>?

class ExternalReader {
  /// May be specified as an absolute path to an executable
  /// May also be specified as just an executable name, in which case it will be resolved according to the PATH environment variable
  executable: String

  /// Command line arguments that will be passed to the reader process
  arguments: Listing<String>
}
----

=== Language Binding Libraries

The language binding libraries `pkl-go` and `pkl-swift` will be expanded to support using and implementing external readers.
For the purpose of illustration, examples will be provided using Golang.

The `EvaluatorOptions` type will be expanded to include a new property for external readers:

[source,go]
----
type EvaluatorOptions struct {
	// ...
    ExternalModuleReaders map[string]ExternalReader
    ExternalResourceReaders map[string]ExternalReader
	// ...
}

type ExternalReader struct {
	Executable string
	Arguments []string
}
----

A new `ExternalReaderClient` type will be introduced to implement the child process message passing interface.
It makes sense to expand the existing libraries to add this functionality as much of the message passing infrastructure and types for implementing resource and module readers can be reused.
An `ExternalReaderClient` is configured with zero or more `ResourceReader` instances and zero or more `ModuleReader` instances.
When started, the client will consume messages from the configured `Reader`, dispatch calls to the configured readers, and send responses to the configured `Writer`.

[source,go]
----
type ExternalReaderClient interface {
  Run()
  Close()
}

type ExternalReaderClientOptions struct {
	// ResourceReaders are the resource readers to be used by the evaluator.
	ResourceReaders []ResourceReader

	// ModuleReaders are the set of custom module readers to be used by the evaluator.
	ModuleReaders []ModuleReader

	// Input reader to consume messages from Pkl from
	// Defaults to os.Stdin if not set
	Input io.Reader

	// Output writer to produce message to Pkl
	// Defaults to os.Stdout if not set
	Output io.Writer
}

func NewExternalReaderClient(opts ...func(options *ExternalReaderClientOptions)) ExternalReaderClient {
  // ...
}

var WithResourceReaders = // ...
var WithModuleReaders = // ...
var WithStreams = // ...
----

== Compatibility

From a language perspective, this proposal is purely additive.

In the case where newer language bindings configure external readers against an older `pkl` binary, the new `CreateEvaluatorRequest.external(Module|Resource)Readers` fields will be ignored silently.
If module evaluation relies on configured external readers, it will fail accordingly.

Any usage of the pkl-server APIs that are moving to pkl-core will break.
It's unlikely there are clients of these APIs outside the apple/pkl repo.

== Future directions

* Configuration of external readers via `~/.pkl/settings.pkl`
* Support for specifying URIs for external reader executables so they may be distributed in Pkl packages.
This is potentially very valuable for statically compiled reader binaries, but significantly complicates the implementation.
The design, as proposed, does not prohibit implementing this as a future enhancement.
This would also make it very convenient to bundle reader executables inside packages to provide friendly, type-safe, and self-contained Pkl APIs for complex reader URI schemes instead of having the "stringly-typed" URI as the primary API, e.g. building on the `ldap:` example:
+
[source,pkl]
----
import "pkl:json"

typealias LDAPResult = Mapping<String, Listing<String>>

class LDAPQuery {
    protocol: *"ldap"|"ldaps"
    host: String
    port: UInt16 = 389
    baseDN: String
    attributes: Listing<String>
    scope: *"base"|"one"|"sub"
    filter: String = "(&)" // matches anything

    fixed results: Listing<LDAPResult> = new json.Parser { useMapping = true }.parse(
        read("\(protocol)://\(host):\(port)/\(baseDN)?\(attributes.join(","))?\(scope)?\(filter)").text
    ) as Listing<LDAPResult>
}

local queryResults = new LDAPQuery {
    host = "ds.example.com"
    baseDN = "dc=example,dc=com"
    attributes { "mail" }
    scope = "sub"
    filter = "(uid=\(username))"
}.results

username = "john_appleseed"

email = queryResults[0]["mail"][0]
----

== Alternatives considered

=== One shot, per-read subprocesses

Instead of using the msgpack message-passing API, reader binaries could be invoked with the read URI as a CLI argument and return their result on standard output.
This potentially greatly lowers the barrier to entry for implementing external readers, even allowing them to be implemented by shell scripts.

This approach does not have a clean way to support globbed reads.
To resolve globs, Pkl can require many list modules/resources requests.
It's not clear how one-shot reader processes could be invoked differently to distinguish read requests from list requests.
Multiple invocations would also have potentially significant overhead, especially for readers implemented in interpreted languages.

There is definitely value in supporting significantly reduced barrier to reader implementation, especially when globbing is not required.
One way this gap might be closed is with a "shim" reader process that translates the message passing API calls to subprocess invocations:

[source,text]
----
$ pkl eval <module> --external-resource-reader ldap='pkl-cmd ldap=pkl-ldap.sh'
username = "john_appleseed"
email = "appleseed@example.com"
----

It may even make sense for the `pkl` binary itself to provide this functionality.
