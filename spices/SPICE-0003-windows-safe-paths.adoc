= Windows Safe Paths

* Proposal: xref:SPICE-0003-windows-safe-paths.adoc[SPICE-0003]
* Author: link:https://github.com/bioball[Dan Chao]
* Status: Accepted
* Implemented in: Pkl 0.26
* Category: Language

== Introduction

In order to support running Pkl on Windows, filepaths are encoded to be compatible on Windows operating systems.

== Motivation

Currently, Pkl is only supported for macOS and Linux.
On these operating systems, the only characters reserved in filepaths are `0x0` (null byte), and `/` (the directory separator).

On Windows, the characters `<`, `>`, `:`, `"`, `\`, `|`, `?`, and `*` are also reserved.
Additionally, character code points `0x1` through `0x1f` are also illegal.

In situations where filepaths are written to disk, operations to write filepaths that contain these characters will either fail or have otherwise unexpected behavior.

== Proposed Solution

In order to be compatible with Windows, filepaths will be encoded to be compatible with Windows.

These are the situations where Pkl will write encoded paths to disk:

1. Writing packages to the cache directory, when using `--cache-dir` or when using the default cache dir.
2. Creating documentation via `pkldoc`, or the `pkl-doc` Java library.
3. Generating Kotlin code through `pkl-codegen-kotlin`.

NOTE: Java identifiers cannot use any of the reserved Windows characters, so we do not need to change the behavior of `pkl-codegen-java`.

=== Files written from `pkl eval` are not escaped

Pkl will _not_ write encoded filepaths during regular evaluation.
When executing `pkl eval -o "foo:bar" myModule.pkl` on Windows, Pkl will attempt to write a filename called `foo:bar`, the I/O error is bubbled up to the user.

Additionally, the paths specified within `output.files` when using link:https://pkl-lang.org/main/current/language-reference/index.html#multiple-file-output[multiple-file output] will be written verbatim without escaping, and any I/O errors are bubbled up to the user.

These paths are not encoded because:

1. They are user-specified. +
It can be a confusing experience if `pkl eval -o foo:bar` produced a _different_ filename on operating systems where this is supported.
It can also be a confusing experience if Pkl behaved differently on different operating systems.
2. It preserves compatiblity with current Pkl.

== Detailed design

=== Filename encoding

Characters that aren't safe on Windows are encoded by enclosing their hexadecimal character code in parentheses.

The open parenthesis literal `(` is encoded as `((`.

Examples:

|===
|Verbatim |Encoded

|`foo:bar`
|`foo(3a)bar`

|`foo<bar`
|`foo(3c)bar`

|`foo(3a)bar`
|`foo((3a)bar`

|`((((`
|`((((((((`

|illegal
|`foo(`

|illegal
|`foo()bar`

|illegal
|`foo(az)bar`
|===

The closing delimiter `)` future-proofs the possibility of needing to encode characters that can't be expressed with only two hex characters.

=== Package Cache: `package-2`

Cached packages will be written to a new subdirectory called `package-2` within the user-specified cache directory.

This prevents possibility of conflicts.
For example, this prevents an issue where the current version of Pkl and newer versions of Pkl might use the same cache location for different packages called `package://example.com/foo(3a)bar`, and `package://example.com/foo:bar`.

The package `package://example.com/foo:bar` will be written to directory `package-2/example.com/foo(3a)bar`.

=== Prior art

Kotlin's Dokka encodes Windows-unsafe characters with the decimal character code, enclosed with square brackets.

A class called `class `Foo:bar`` creates a file called `Foo[58]bar.html`.
However, this encoding uses characters that are not URI-safe, resulting in more bytes when representing them in URLs (`Foo%5B58%5Dbar.html`), and subjectively, less aesthetically pleasing URIs.

== Compatibility

This proposal is backwards compatibility for evaluation. However, it does mean that the cache directory needs to be re-populated.

This proposal will change existing links for pkldoc websites. A Pkl class called `Foo:bar` will need to have any links updated from `Foo:bar.html` to `Foo(3c)bar.html`.

== Future directions

N/A

== Alternatives considered

The encoding described here is a _new_ encoding protocol.
Other encoding protocols considered are HTML character entity encoding, and percent encoding.

The drawback of these encoding is that they use characters that are not URI-safe.
In order to represent them as URIs, they are doubly encoded.

|===
| encoding name | verbatim | local path | URI path

| percent
| `foo:bar`
| `foo%3Cbar`
| `foo%253Cbar`

| HTML character entity
| `foo:bar`
| `foo\&#58;bar`
| `foo%26%2358%3Bbar`
|===

Percent-encoding results in five URI bytes to represent the colon literal.
HTML character entity encoding results in eleven URI bytes to represent the colon literal.

Additionally, using percent-encoding can make implementations more challenging, because it is hard to determine whether a character has already been encoded or not when creating HTML links.
