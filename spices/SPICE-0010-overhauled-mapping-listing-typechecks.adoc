= Overhauled Mapping/Listing Typechecks

* Proposal: link:./SPICE-0010-overhauled-mapping-listing-typechecks.adoc[SPICE-0010]
* Status: TBD
* Implemented in: Pkl TBD
* Category: Language

== Introduction

During typechecks for Listings and Mappings, retain laziness of their object members.

== Motivation

Currently, in order to typecheck a listing or mapping, Pkl will shallow-force its members.

For example, in the following snippet:

[source,pkl]
----
class Bird { name: String }

hidden birds: Listing<Bird> = new {
  new { name = "Osprey" }
  new { name = "Warbler" }
}

numBirds = birds[0]
//         ^^^^^
----

During execution of `birds` (as highlighted by the carets), Pkl will execute both members of `birds`, including `new { name = "Warbler" }`, even though it is not used in producing the program's result.

In psuedocode, Pkl executes the following instructions:

[source]
----
assert value instanceof Listing
for elem in value.members():
  assert elem.eval() instanceof Bird
----

There are two underlying issues with this approach.

=== Performance cost

Executing every member of a mapping or listing can be expensive.

Here is a sample snippet of code, where a glob-import is used to match multiple modules, but yet only one module is selected:

[source,pkl]
----
import "Database.pkl"

local dbs: Mapping<String, Database> = import*("*/database.pkl")

cluster: String

fixed database: Database = dbs["\(cluster)/database.pkl"]
----

A glob import desguars to a mapping, where each member is its own import. Thus, the above import might turn into the following in a real-world codebase:

[source,pkl]
----
local dbs: Mapping<String, Database> = new {
  ["us-west-1/database.pkl"] = import("us-west-1/database.pkl")
  ["us-west-2/database.pkl"] = import("us-west-2/database.pkl")
  ["us-west-3/database.pkl"] = import("us-west-3/database.pkl")
  ["us-east-1/database.pkl"] = import("us-east-1/database.pkl")
  ["us-east-2/database.pkl"] = import("us-east-2/database.pkl")
  ["us-east-3/database.pkl"] = import("us-west-3/database.pkl")
  // etc...
}
----

While executing `db`, in order to perform type checking, Pkl will execute every import.
In this example, it will import as many modules as match the glob pattern.
As this codebase scales, this snippet will become more expensive.

=== Thrown errors are too coarse

During the typecheck, an error that occurs from reading a mapping or listing member turns into an error when reading the whole object.

This flaw is a limitation in Pkl's own testing framework.
In `pkl:test`, `facts` are defined as `Mapping<String, Listing<Boolean>>`.
A thrown error from a single fact gets turned into an error on all facts, because the error gets thrown when the top-level `facts` property is evaluated.

Here is a sample test:

[source,pkl]
----
amends "pkl:test"

facts {
  ["bad fact"] {
    throw("uh oh")
  }
  ["good fact"] {
    1 + 1 == 2
  }
}
----

Running this produces the following output:

[source]
----
module test (file:///test.pkl, line 1)
  test ❌
    Error:
        –– Pkl Error ––
        uh oh

        5 | throw("uh oh")
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        at test#facts["incorrect fact"][#1] (file:///test.pkl, line 5)

        3 | facts {
            ^^^^^^^
        at test#facts (file:///test.pkl, line 3)
----

The report does not show "some good fact" in the output, and treats the entire test as an error.

A better test report should look like so:

[source]
----
module test (file:///test.pkl, line 1)
  incorrect fact ❌
    Error:
        –– Pkl Error ––
        uh oh

        5 | throw("uh oh")
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        at test#facts["incorrect fact"][#1] (file:///test.pkl, line 5)
  some good fact ✅
----

Currently, this report is not possible to produce, because reading the top-level `facts` itself will throw the nested member's exception.

== Proposed Solution

To address this, we will defer typechecking of `Mapping` and `Listing` members to when the members are evaluated.

Here is a sample program, and the steps taken by the interpreter:

[source,pkl]
----
class Person { name: String }

local people: Listing<Person> = new {
  new { name = "Sandra" }
  new { name = "Zoe" }
}

numPeople = people.length // <1>

sandra = people[0] // <2>
----
<1> Neither Sandra nor Zoe are evaluated; yields `2`.
<2> Sandra is evaluated, and checked against type `Person`. Zoe is not evaluated. Yields `new Person { name = "Sandra" }`.

Here is a more poignant example, where second member is simply a `throw`.

[source,pkl]
----
class Person { name: String }

local people: Listing<Person> = new {
  new { name = "Sandra" }
  throw("uh oh")
}

numPeople = people.length

sandra = people[0]
----

Yet, Pkl still successfully evaluates this program, because the second member is not in the critical path of evaluation.

This principle is consistent with how Pkl behaves generally.
The property `local foo = throw("uh oh")` similarly does not affect the result of a program, as long as `foo` is never referenced.

== Detailed design

The typecheck of a Mapping and Listing will _type cast_ the value.

Here is a source snippet:

[source,pkl]
----
people: Listing<Person> = new {
  new { name = "Sandra" }
  new { name = "Zoe" }
}
----

And here is the same snippet with the implied instructions:

[source,pkl]
----
people: Listing<Person> = new {
  new { name = "Sandra" } as Person // <1>
  new { name = "Zoe" } as Person
} as Listing // <2>
----
<1> A type cast is added to each member.
<2> The overall result is casted to `Listing`.

[#delegating-objects]
=== Delegating objects

Underneath the hood, casting a listing or mapping returns a _new_ listing/mapping.

This new object delegates to the original object.
It behaves just like the original, except its members receive type casts too.
This type cast may or may not throw an error.

Given this:

[source,pkl]
----
listing = new Listing { "hello" }

listingOfNumbers: Listing<Int> = listing
----

`"hello"` is not an `Int`, so this program should fail.
Because typechecking is deferred, this failure should not occur until `listing[0]` is evaluated.

Effectively, `listing` and `listingOfNumbers` are _different_ in-memory objects; one which has type assertions at the end of each member, and one which does not.
This difference is opaque to users; these two objects have the same hash code, and same equality semantics.

In the amends chain, `listingOfNumbers` has the same parent as `listing`. It delegates its member lookups to `listing`, and adds a typecheck at the end of each lookup.

In the following scenario:

[source,pkl]
----
listing0 = new Listing { 1; 2; 3 }

listing1 = (listing0) {
  super[0]
}

listing2: Listing<Int> = listing1
----

`listing2` delegates to `listing1`, so its parent is still `listing0`.
Thus, `super[0]` is a lookup of the first member of `listing0`.

=== Operators: Type cast (`as`) vs. Type test (`is`)

The `as` and `is` operators behave differently.

The `is` operator is a type test, and continues to be an _eager_ check.

This snippet deeply evaluates each member, and asserts its result type.

[source,pkl]
----
local people = new Listing {
  new Person { name = "Sandra" }
  new Person { name = "Zoe" }
}

isPeople = people is Listing<Person> // <1>
----
<1> Each member of `people` is evaluated, and asserted to be a `Person`.

On the other hand, the `as` operator is a type cast, and it behaves just like a typecheck does as described in xref:delegating-objects[delegate objects].

[source,pkl]
----
local people = new Listing {
  new Person { name = "Sandra" }
  new Person { name = "Zoe" }
}

myPeople = people as Listing<Person> // <1>
----
<1> `myPeople` is a different object and delegates to `people`

=== `new` with explicit parent

The `new` keyword can be given a type, e.g. `new Listing<Person> {}`.

Currently, this type has no influence on typechecking (see https://github.com/apple/pkl/issues/405[#405]).

The following program executes without a thrown error:

[source,pkl]
----
people = new Listing<Person> { 1; 2; 3 }
----

As part of this change, the above snippet is similarly lazily checked; the member gets casted to `Person` when evaluated.

==== Amending `Listing` and `Mapping`

Amended members of a `Listing` or `Mapping` do not receive type casts.

[source,pkl]
----
listing: Listing<Int> = new { 1; 2; 3 }

listing2 = (listing) { "hello" } // <1>
----
<1> Okay; result is `new Listing { 1; 2; 3; "hello" }`

=== Mapping keys

Mapping keys are still checked eagerly.
This is because keys deep-forced when they are used as an entry key.
In the underlying implementation, mappings are backed by a hash map.
When they are inserted, their hash code is computed, which deep-forces the value.

=== `List`/`Set`/`Map`/`Pair`

The behavior of `List`, `Set`, `Map`, and `Pair` do not change. Their members are _shallowly_ checked, because these are eager object types.

=== Union types

Consider the following:

[source,pkl]
----
myListing: Listing<Int>|Listing<String> = new { 1; "hello" }
----

The value neither a `Listing<Int>` or `Listing<String>`.
We might expect that `myListing[0]` can succeed because it can possibly satisfy `Listing<Int>`.
However, if that holds, Pkl should throw if `myListing[1]` is evaluated.
Somehow, Pkl must know that `listing[0]` and `listing[1]`  cannot both succeed.

In order to typecheck these values correctly, unions types of two or more of the same parameterized type must be checked eagerly.
The following types are eagerly checked:

[source,pkl]
----
value1: Listing<Int>|Listing<String>
value2: Listing<Int>|Listing<String>?
value3: Listing<Int>|(Listing<String>)
value4: Mapping<String, Int>|Mapping<String, String>
value5: List<Listing<String>>|List<Listing<Int>>
----

The following types retain laziness during typecheck:

[source,pkl]
----
value1: Listing<Int>|Int
value2: Listing<Int>|Mapping<String, String>
value3: List<Listing<String>>|Set<String> // <1>
----
<1> `List` is _shallow_ checked; the `Listing` object itself is evaluated, but its members are not.

=== Optimizations

==== `unknown`, `Any`, un-parameterized types

Mappings/Listings with type parameter `unknown` or `Any` do not need to have their members casted.
Therefore, the type cast of a value to `Listing<unknown>` can return the same in-memory object rather than return a xref:delegating-objects[delegating object].

[source,pkl]
----
myListing: Listing<unknown> = someListing // <1>
----
<1> `listing` and `someListing` are the same in-memory object

Un-parameterized `Mapping` and `Listing` objects also do not need to return delegating object. `Listing` is sugar for `Listing<unknown>`.

==== Same typechecks

Two types that are the same typecheck does not need return a <<delegating-objects,delegating object>>.

In the following snippet:

[source,pkl]
----
l1: Listing<String>
l2: Listing<String> = l1
----

`l1` and `l2` have the same type, so we do not need to introduce a new delegating object.

== Compatibility

=== Change in throw behavior

This is a marginally breaking change in the language.
The following program currently throws, and will not throw after this change is implemented:

[source,pkl]
----
local people: Listing<Person> = new {
  throw("Uh oh")
}

len = people.length
----

On the flip-side, the following program does not throw, and will throw after this change is implemented:

[source,pkl]
----
people = new Listing<Person> {
  1
}
----

However, this is considered a bug, and throwing here is simply a fix for the bug.

== Future directions

=== Type-casted `Function` types

Another language bug is in typechecks of anonymous functions (lambdas).

This snippet does not throw, but should:

[source,pkl]
----
local myFunc: (Int) -> Int = (it) -> it
result = myFunc.apply("hello")
----

The fix here should be similar to the fix applied to Listings and Mappings; to cast the provided function into `(Int) -> Int` by returning a _new_ function.

=== Throw when type testing `Function` types

`Function` types can be _casted_, but cannot be _tested_.

[source,pkl]
----
myFunc = (it) -> it as (Int) -> Int // <1>

isMyFunc = myFunc is (Int) -> Int // <2>
----
<1> Fine; we can wrap the provided function with a new function that asserts the types of the parameter and return value
<2> This is impossible to check, because Pkl types do not have the concept of subtypes, and runtime functions do not retain their type signatures.

To be sound, this operation should throw when evaluated.
